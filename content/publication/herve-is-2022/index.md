abstract: Deterministic models have difficulties to take into account stochasticity
  during community assembly. As a tool to circumvent this problem, we present a qualitative
  discrete-event model, where consequences of interspecific interactions are described
  as rules. This model provides a map of all possible future dynamics for a given
  system, which allows to exhaustively describe the possible pathways during an assembly
  process. Such a description does not rely on species traits details and is insensitive
  to stochastic effects. This allows to show that subsets of species are sometimes
  impossible to reach starting from larger sets of species, and therefore to question
  the reachability of community states during the system's dynamics. Applying the
  model to an experimental dataset studying the collapse of protist communities, we
  obtain a very good theory-experiment agreement. We finally discuss what the notion
  of reachability can bring to community assembly.
