abstract: Model-checking is a methodology developed in computer science to automatically
  assess the dynamics of discrete systems, by checking if a system modelled as a state-transition
  graph satisfies a dynamical property written as a temporal logic formula. The dynamics
  of ecosystems have been drawn as state-transition graphs for more than a century,
  ranging from state-and-transition models to assembly graphs. Model-checking can
  provide insights into both empirical data and theoretical models, as long as they
  sum up into state-transition graphs. While model-checking proved to be a valuable
  tool in systems biology, it remains largely underused in ecology apart from precursory
  applications. This article proposes to address this situation, through an inventory
  of existing ecological STGs and an accessible presentation of the model-checking
  methodology. This overview is illustrated by the application of model-checking to
  assess the dynamics of a vegetation pathways model. We select management scenarios
  by model-checking Computation Tree Logic formulas representing management goals
  and built from a proposed catalogue of patterns. In discussion, we sketch bridges
  between existing studies in ecology and available model-checking frameworks. In
  addition to the automated analysis of ecological state-transition graphs, we believe
  that defining ecological concepts with temporal logics could help clarify and compare
  them.
