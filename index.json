The dynamics of ecosystems have been drawn as state-transition graphs for more than a century, ranging from state-and-transition models to assembly graphs. Model-checking can provide insights into both empirical data and theoretical models, as long as they sum up into state-transition graphs. While model-checking proved to be a valuable tool in systems biology, it remains largely underused in ecology apart from precursory applications. This article proposes to address this situation, through an inventory of existing ecological STGs and an accessible presentation of the model-checking methodology. This overview is illustrated by the application of model-checking to assess the dynamics of a vegetation pathways model. We select management scenarios by model-checking Computation Tree Logic formulas representing management goals and built from a proposed catalogue of patterns. In discussion, we sketch bridges between existing studies in ecology and available model-checking frameworks. In addition to the automated analysis of ecological state-transition graphs, we believe that defining ecological concepts with temporal logics could help clarify and compare them.","tags":[],"title":"Model-Checking Ecological State-Transition Graphs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Franck Pommereau","Colin Thomas","Cédric Gaucherel"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1674659486,"objectID":"717561533aa7d1e32cebfef4f03705c1","permalink":"https://colinthomas-pro.github.io/publication/pommereau-eden-2022/","publishdate":"2023-01-25T15:11:26.266297Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pommereau-eden-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"EDEN Framework for Interactive Analysis of Ecosystems Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mathieu de Goër de Herve","Colin Thomas","Maximilien Cosme","Philip Warren","Cédric Gaucherel"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1674659486,"objectID":"c8756d548bda2361d5d612bdb92e1e27","permalink":"https://colinthomas-pro.github.io/publication/herve-is-2022/","publishdate":"2023-01-25T15:11:25.959378Z","relpermalink":"/publication/herve-is-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Deterministic models have difficulties to take into account stochasticity during community assembly. As a tool to circumvent this problem, we present a qualitative discrete-event model, where consequences of interspecific interactions are described as rules. This model provides a map of all possible future dynamics for a given system, which allows to exhaustively describe the possible pathways during an assembly process. Such a description does not rely on species traits details and is insensitive to stochastic effects. This allows to show that subsets of species are sometimes impossible to reach starting from larger sets of species, and therefore to question the reachability of community states during the system's dynamics. Applying the model to an experimental dataset studying the collapse of protist communities, we obtain a very good theory-experiment agreement. We finally discuss what the notion of reachability can bring to community assembly.","tags":[],"title":"Is a Community State Reachable, and Why?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Franck Pommereau","Colin Thomas","Cédric Gaucherel"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1674659486,"objectID":"536b5258d4568e6719d9d5b9dae4d4e0","permalink":"https://colinthomas-pro.github.io/publication/pommereau-petri-2022/","publishdate":"2023-01-25T15:11:26.54561Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pommereau-petri-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Petri Nets Semantics of Reaction Rules (RR)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Colin Thomas"],"categories":null,"content":" Create your slides in Markdown - click the Slides button to check out the example.
